    <h1> Lab 4: Document</h1>
    <h2>I will lead you to the steps by showing my screenshots of codes and results with this.
        Also, how I approach to have 3 insights.
    </h2>
    <p>
        I filtered pollster by their grade. I thought that if the grade is lower than A-, then that pollster data is hard to trust.

        Then, I looked into dataset and realized that this data contains candidates who dropped out. So, I filtered them out and created 'df2' dataframe.

    <ol>
        <li>First Insight: What kinds of voters voted for which candidate? </li>

        <li>Third Insight: Who is Winning By the State?</li>

    </ol> 
    <p>
        There were other two insights, which makes my insight to be 5.
        Other Two Insights:
        <ol>
            <li>Which States has highest competitive percentages between democratic and republic?</li>
            <li>Which pollster showed highest pct depends on the candidate?</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
